# Why
The very first reason definately is *[RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)*, inspired by this book *[Free as in Freedom
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_as_in_Freedom)*.   And I am totally moved by RMS, this man might be the only thorough idealist in the world. Thanks to his stubborn , now we have one of the  most popular open source operating systems  with more than tens of thousands of developers, yes, that is GNU/Linux OS. 

Get back to Emacs, I started using Emacs is just out of curiosity, I mean, it's called the editor of gods anyway,  who wouldn't wanna give it a try? Actually I used to use Vim most time on Linux servers (even now... because it indeed loads faster than emacs, God Bless Uganda, just saying).

The official GNU Emacs Manual  calls Emacs
> *the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time display editor*

To be honest, it tells beginners almost nothing about Emacs.  As far as now, the best awesome part of Emacs for me is Org-mode, as you can check [there](https://orgmode.org/), 
> *Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.*

I've spent many hours tweaking my Emacs to use Org mode for my daily GTD management, which is also the main reason I am using Emacs.  

# How
## Resources
I kind of started from this github repo: [Master Emacs in One Year](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide) and many online resources: blogs, tutorials, basically just googling everything I want to know.

LIst some awesome resources (which I remembered to bookmark,):
* [The Org Manual](https://orgmode.org/org.html)
* [Master Emacs in One Year](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide)
* [Reddit Emacs Topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/)
* [Planet Emacsen](https://planet.emacslife.com/)
* [Emacs Meetup Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6INMXmsCCC8&list=PL8tzorAO7s0he-pp7Y_JDl7-Kz2Qlr_Pj) (Awesome contents with many interesting sharing, like you can even order salad from emacs)

## How I use
1. Copy others' setting :
`git clone https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d `

2. Tweak until death

I created a git repository called "orgfiles" for all my org files. In this way I can use git to synchronize my files among different computers. each computer will auto push modified content under orgfiles directory every minute, I am using `crontab` doing this:
```
*/60 * * * * /bin/sh /home/snape/auto_push.sh >> /home/error.log
```
However, sometimes if I forgot exiting from Emacs on one computer and just kept that session, when I accessed Emacs from another computer the file would be locked, and using Git to  synchronize also has conflict problems, still trying to solve this, maybe I will use dropbox instead of Git later. 

I label my org files into two directories:
* GTD
* Writing

they are both under "orgfiles" directory.

For GTD, I have these orgfiles in total:
* todo.org
* tolearn.org
* tonote.org
* ideas.org

But recently I want to use Emacs everywhere, that I even add two more org files for my life entertainment (.....ok):

* togo.org
* tobuy.org

now everyday I just need to open Emacs and have a nice day 

and ... tweaking:

Happy hacks, Emacs love you :)

Still long way to go
