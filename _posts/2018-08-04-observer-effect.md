**Observe him.**
**Get to know everything about him.** 
**And be sure of nothing about him.**
**Stalk him,** 
**Attract him,**
**Support him,**
**Judge him,**
**Challenge everything he believes in,**
**Sacrifice everything for what he believes in,**
**Unlock his heart,** 
**Run right into his heart,**
**Influence his thoughts,**
**Rebuild his minding,**
**Watch him, **
**Take away his pride,**
**And youth.**
 
 
**Change his whole life forever the moment he was observed.**
**And then,**

**Love him.**
**Like God damn love him.**
**Like die to love him.**

**Like uncertainty principle is the only truth left**
