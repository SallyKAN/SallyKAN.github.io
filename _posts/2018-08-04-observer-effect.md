**Observe him.**<br/>
**Get to know everything about him.** <br/>
**And be sure of nothing about him.**<br/>
**Stalk him,** <br/>
**Attract him,**<br/>
**Support him,**<br/>
**Judge him,**<br/>
**Challenge everything he believes in,**<br/>
**Sacrifice everything for what he believes in,**<br/>
**Unlock his heart,** <br/>
**Run right into his heart,**<br/>
**Influence his thoughts,**<br/>
**Rebuild his minding,**<br/>
**Watch him,**<br/>
**Take away his pride,**<br/>
**And youth.**<br/>
 
 
**Change his whole life forever the moment he was observed.**<br/>
**And then,**<br/>

**Love him.**<br/>
**Like God damn love him.**<br/>
**Like die to love him.**<br/>

**Like uncertainty principle is the only truth left**<br/>
