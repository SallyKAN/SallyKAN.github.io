This post would show how I build go-ethereum on my Win10 computer, and if you  are interested in build, develop, debug, submit a bug report or pull request or contribute code to go-ethereum, you can do this as well.

# What you need
## Go Environment
Make sure you have `go ` v1.8 installed, and the GOPATH is set.  
If you don't, just download and run the installer found at http://golang.org/doc/install ( In this post, I assume you are using Windows system as me. ) 
Then you need to set GOPATH and PATH,  search "Environment Variablesâ€œ in the start menu, add " PATH_TO_YOUR_GO_DIRECTORY/bin" to PATH variable. 
Now check if your Go is working right by:

![Cmd windows]({{ "/img/screenshot.png "| "C:\Users\K\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\SallyKAN.github.io\img\screenshot.png"}})

## go-ethereum source code

Get the source code code into the right place:
```
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
```

**Note**:You must have your working copy under $GOPATH/src/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum.
For example I am using  "C:\Users\K\go\src\github.com\ethereum\go-ethereum" 

>Since go does not use relative path for import, working in any other directory will have no effect, since the import paths will be appended to $GOPATH/src, and if the lib does not exist, the version at master HEAD will be downloaded.

# What you need to do
## Managing Dependencies

[govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) is used to manage all other dependencies.
run `govendor fetch <import-path>`  to add a new dependency, then commit the result.
run `govendor fetch +v` to update all dependencies to their latest upstream version
## Building Executables
Go to the go-ethereum repository root directory.
Build all code using the go tool, placing the resulting binary in $GOPATH/bin:
```
go install -v ./...
```

go-ethereum exectuables can be built individually. To build just geth, use:
```
go install -v ./cmd/geth
```

## Getting Stack Traces
the` --pprof` option would make a debugging HTTP server available on port 6060
Then you can bring up http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof to see the heap, running routines etc. 
To generate stacktraces for many geth instances:
```
geth -port=30300 -verbosity 5 --pprof --pprofport 6060 2>> 00.glog
geth -port=30301 -verbosity 5 --pprof --pprofport 6061 2>> 01.glog
geth -port=30302 -verbosity 5 --pprof --pprofport 6062 2>> 02.glog
```
In the above commands, `-verbosity` means Logging verbosity: 0=silent, 1=error, 2=warn, 3=info, 4=debug, 5=detail (default: 3)

Instead of connecting to tha main network,  you may perfer connect to your own private network for testing, in this case just add some other options:
```
geth --datadir="/path_to_your_data_directory/YOUR_FOLDER" init "path_to_folder/CustomGenesis.json"  console 2>> logs\01.glog

geth -port=30300 --ipcdisable --pprof --pprofport 6060 --datadir="/path_to_your_data_directory/YOUR_FOLDER"   --networkid id  console 2>> logs\00.glog

geth -port=30301--ipcdisable --pprof --pprofport 6061 --datadir="/path_to_your_data_directory/YOUR_FOLDER" --networkid id  console 2>> logs\01.glog

geth -port=30302--ipcdisable --pprof --pprofport 6062 --
datadir="/path_to_your_data_directory/YOUR_FOLDER" --networkid id  console 2>> logs\02.glog

```
