I have been working on a web project recently, this project  utilizes Java and Spring MVC framework. Since I  haven't use Spring MVC framework for quite a time, I need to pick up the knowledge a little bit again.  So the first step would be building the development environment in IDE, in this project, I am using IntelliJ IDEA.
