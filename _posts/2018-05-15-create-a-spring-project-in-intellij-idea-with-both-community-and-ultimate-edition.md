I have been working on a web project recently, this project  utilizes Java and Spring MVC framework. Since I  haven't used Spring MVC framework for quite a time, I need to pick up the knowledge a little bit again.  So the first step would be building the development environment in IDE, in this project, I am using IntelliJ IDEA.

So for the community edition, there is no Spring module provided,  you need to create the configure xml file yourself.
Here is how you can do this from scratch:
 
 Open IntelliJ IDEA, chose File -> Projetc,Chose Maven and create a new project:
 
 ![create a new project]({{ "/img/blog2.png "| "C:\Users\K\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\SallyKAN.github.io\img\blog2.png"}})
