Iot system architecture

main 4 stages

sensors 

network gateway, data acquisition

gateway main roles

data management

local application

example: home alarm logic

devices management

edge IT

performs preprocessing tasks for data before sending it to cloud center, example: machine learning requires immediate attention

data center, cloud

performs in-depth processing, physical data center or cloud based center, do not need immediate feedback.

Big Data

what is it: refer to the large data sets which need to be collected, stored, analyzed, and managed to deliver IoT insight

what is it for

Cloud Computing

defination: a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network to access shared computing resources

3 models: Saas, Paas, IaaS

why for IOT: provide the virtual infrastructure for IoT applications to enable users to access applications on demand anytime, anywhere 

Application Analytic software 

examples?

which part to analyse?

Digital twin

descrip it: as the sensors collecting all the real-time data, a set of models forming a digital twin that is updated with all the same information.
